# Gargantua
A 2d game engine for my personal game that i want to develop.
This is my first real project in C++ and my first engine.
Note on c++20: i want to use c++20 because i like the way the c++ is evolving. 
Note on c++ modules: Impossible to use even in visual studio :(. Too much bugs and cryptic errors.

Note: i wanted to use only opengl and glfw since the beginning of the project so most of the class are not abstract (for the API definition); the only platform supported is 
Windows with opengl and glfw. 

Resource that i found useful:  
TheCerno game engine series.  
Godot engine source code.  
Spring RTS source code.  
Ogre engine source code.
